    <h4>Title, Summary and Team Members</h4>
    <p>Spooky Boo!</p>
    <p>
      For our project, we will be making a spooky scene with multiple objects, both moving and stationary. 
      We will use various textures and shaders to model these items’ material — for example, a wood texture for a table, 
      or a thin fabric (i.e satin) texture for a ghost. We also intend to add environmental factors such as wind to make 
      the ghost fabric move and flickering illumination within the pumpkin.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h4>Problem Description</h4>
    <p>
      In previous homework assignments, we haven’t worked with both stationary and moving objects simultaneously. 
      We want to combine what we learned in Homeworks 3 and 4 to generate a scene that supports static and dynamic objects, 
      since that mimics scenes in the real world best.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be challenging to make our staged wind movement represent real world movement, such as if the ghost’s 
      fabric moves with the correct speed. Another challenge is learning how to use Blender or Autodesk Maya to 3D 
      model the different objects in the scene, such as the pumpkin or different cloth used for the ghost’s fabric.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h4>Goals and Deliverables</h4>
    <p>
      To showcase our final result, we will record a video of our scene with all of the different functionalities displayed. 
      This will include all of the moving parts, and how the shaders interact with light when the model is moving. The stationary
      objects will also be hit with the light source, showing the details of the texture that we created. We can also potentially 
      zoom in the camera on certain parts of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will qualitatively view the elements in the scene and compare them to how they would appear in real life. For example, 
      we will examine how realistic the texture of the pumpkin’s skin is. We can also check how smoothly the ghost’s cloth flutters 
      in response to wind, and how smooth the metal of the chairs is. With the different types of illumination/lighting, we can measure
      the timing differences in how the scene is generated. Since the scene has a multitude of objects and factors, this leaves room for 
      the possibility of determining what tradeoffs are more important (i.e sacrificing visual detail for faster generation time).
    </p>
    <p>
      In what ways can environmental factors like wind and light affect a scene?<br>
      How can different textures interact with each other in one scene? Within one object, like a pumpkin, 
      how would multiple textures interact? What do points of contact between textures look like (for example, 
      the contact points between the wood of a stem and the smoothness of the skin)?<br>
      In what ways do static and dynamic objects interact with each other in a scene? How do elements like 
      lighting and shadows affect these interactions?
    </p>
    <p>
      Our plan:<br>
      We plan to create the shaders and textures needed for our scene. This will include wood, grass, 
      fabric for the ghost, pumpkin skin, metal for some chairs, and more. The shaders, specifically the 
      fabric and grass, will be able to still look realistic while moving.<br>
      Our hope:<br>
      Our aspirational plan is to have the environment make more of an impact on our scene. We could 
      potentially have varying gusts of wind blowing in the scene or allow the user to interact with our 
      scene by being able to change the wind gust speed. We could also make multiple textures interact — 
      for example, the ghost brushing against the pumpkin skin by allowing the user to move the ghost or pumpkin.

    <h4>Schedule</h4>
    <p>
      <b>Week 1 (4/2-4/7)</b><br>
        Model: <br>
      Various objects in scene (pumpkin, table, chair, candle, etc)<br>
        Textures: <br>
      Render static objects (we just want to get the pumpkin, wooden table, anything that is intended to be 
          stationary to render individually, then all together in one scene)<br>
      <b>Week 2 (4/8-4/14)</b><br>
        Shaders: <br>
      Render dynamic objects (now, we want to render moving objects on their own, ie. a ghost moving 
      and a candle flickering, however, not concerning ourselves with how the dynamic objects affect other parts of the scene<br>
      <b>Week 3 (4/15-4/21)</b><br>
        Shaders:<br>
        We believe that shaders may be complicated enough to require 2 weeks, so we are keeping this as a buffer week to finish that up from the previous week.<br>
        We also intend to spend a lot of this week studying for the midterm on 4/22 this week so may not have as much time to get things done.<br>
      <b>Week 4 (4/22-4/28)</b><br>
        Make the scene cohesive and realistic<br>
        Have static and dynamic objects interact<br>
        For example, Flickering light should cause shadows and lighting changes on the pumpkin skin<br>
